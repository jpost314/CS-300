# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Project One revolved around the run-time and memory analysis of the possible data structures that could be used to for my algorithymic design for ABCU's course planner. Project Two involved the actual development of a program that would work based off of the pseudocode from Project One. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used Big-O notation to analyze the run-times of the different structures, along with other factors that played a direct role in this particular program (notably, producing an ordered list). After the analysis, I developed pseudocode for this algorithm that gave me a roadmap 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
