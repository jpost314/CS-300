What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Project One revolved around the run-time and memory analysis of the possible data structures that could be used to for my algorithymic design for ABCU's course planner. Project Two involved the actual development of a program that would work based off of the pseudocode from Project One. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used Big-O notation to analyze the run-times of the different structures, along with other factors that played a direct role in this particular program (notably, producing an ordered list). After the analysis, I developed pseudocode for this algorithm that gave me a roadmap to develop the program itself. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest roadblock was working with the csv file paths. I have not overcome this yet, as I am still encountering compliation errors with importing my files. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project taught me a lot about the importance of data structure analysis and choosing the correct structure for a given project. I tend to stick to things that I am comfortable with, but that is not always the best option for every specific project. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

These projects reinforced the importance of documentation when designing maintainable and adaptable code. I utilized several in-line comments in sections that needed more improvement. By using these comments to tag areas that I was unsure about, I was able to easily find them and continue working on the specific areas that needed improvement.
